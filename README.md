# Aurabet
Created an alphabet(Aurabet) based from the English alphabet.

Hello! This is my first personal project with python and GUIs. 
I it not the prettiest or most efficient work I have written, but I am proud call it my own.

What my work includes here is custom dictionary (Aurabet) for PracticeSoft.py to call from.

PracticeSoft.py creates a window for the user to use to practice learning to form words alphabet and identify symbols in my alphabet.
This was something that I made for myself, so it is not the most user friendly.
